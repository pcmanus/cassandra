/**
 * Represents one connection to a peer, and handles the state transistions on the connection and the netty {@link Channel}
 * The underlying socket is not opened until explicitly requested (by sending a message).
 *
 * The basic setup for the channel is like this: a message is requested to be sent via {@link #sendMessage(MessageOut, int)}.
 * If the channel is not established, then we need to create it (obviously). To prevent multiple threads from creating
 * independent connections, they attempt to update the {@link #state} via the {@link #stateUpdater}; one thread will win the race
 * and create the connection. Upon sucessfully setting up the connection/channel, the {@link #state} will be updated again
 * (to {@link State#READY}, which indicates to other threads that the channel is ready for business and can be written to.
 *
 * Note on flushing: when sending a message to the netty {@link Channel}, we call {@link Channel#write(Object)} when
 * coalescing is enabled but {@link Channel#writeAndFlush(Object)} is disabled. The reason is that, at least as of netty
 * 4.1.8, {@link Channel#writeAndFlush(Object)} causes the  netty event loop thread to be woken up, whereas
 * {@link Channel#write(Object)} does not. And without coalescing, we want the thread to wake up so the write is
 * processed immediately or otherwise processing latency would be introduced (this doesn't trigger a genuine flush
 * however due to our overriding in {@link MessageOutHandler#flush(ChannelHandlerContext)}). With coalescing however,
 * there is no point in waking up the thread until the conditions for the coalesce have been fulfilled (number of
 * messages, elapsed time).
 *
 * For more details about the flushing behavior, please see the class-level documentation on {@link MessageOutHandler}.
