 * Storage engine representation of a row.
 *
 * A row is identified by it's clustering column values (it's an Unfiltered),
 * has row level informations (deletion and partition key liveness infos (see below))
 * and contains data (Cells) regarding the columns it contains.
 *
 * A row implements {@code WithLivenessInfo} and has thus a timestamp, ttl and
 * local deletion time. Those information do not apply to the row content, they
 * apply to the partition key columns. In other words, the timestamp is the
 * timestamp for the partition key columns: it is what allows to distinguish
 * between a dead row, and a live row but for which only the partition key columns
 * are set. The ttl and local deletion time information are for the case where
 * a TTL is set on those partition key columns. Note however that a row can have
 * live cells but no partition key columns timestamp, because said timestamp (and
 * its corresponding ttl) is only set on INSERT (not UPDATE).

     * the row itself), the returned {@code LivenessInfo} can only have a local deletion time
